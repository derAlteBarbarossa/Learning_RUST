# Learn RUST through code eaxmples


Learning a new programming langiage can be a pain in the neck!

When you already have good coding experience with some other programming languages, sitting behind your desk and flipping through pages of a programming book to learn syntax is sometimes too overwhelming, that learning the semantics and conecpts would be shadowed.

The goal of this reposiroty is to help those who **already know some high-level programming languages** to learn RUST.

Subdirectories are ordered, just as a suggestion for study path. In each subdirectory, you can find a markdown file, in which I tried to explain the concepts, with help of examples from *The Rust Programming Language*, which you can find under `Books/`. Obviously, what I presented in this repository can only serve for introductory purposes and could in no case replace the Rust book.

Under `Projects`, you can find my implementation of some projects discussed either in the Rust book or in the other book *Practical System Programming for Rust Developers*.

This repository is a work-in-progress, and I would try to add more interesting stuff, elaborate more on some concepts, and introduce advanced features of Rust programming language.
